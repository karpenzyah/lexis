1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,663
The world is changed.

2
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:40,791
I feel it in the water.

3
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,462
I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:49,050
I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,427
Much that once was...

6
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,137
...is lost.

7
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,849
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:14,158
It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.

9
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,369
Three were given to the Elves:

10
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:20,289
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

11
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,417
Seven to the Dwarf-lords:

12
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:28,589
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

13
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,383
And nine...

14
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:33,594
...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...

15
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:37,556
...who, above all else, desire power.

16
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:43,896
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

17
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,567
But they were all of them deceived.

18
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,903
For another ring was made.

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,324
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

20
00:01:55,741 --> 00:02:00,288
...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...

21
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,540
...to control all others.

22
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:06,711
And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

23
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:11,048
...and his will to dominate all life.

24
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:15,886
One Ring to rule them all.

25
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:18,472
One by one...

26
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:23,352
...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.

27
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:26,522
But there were some who resisted.

28
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:31,736
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

29
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,490
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

30
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,440
Victory was near.

31
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,946
But the power of the Ring...

32
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,199
...could not be undone.

33
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,809
It was in this moment...

34
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,395
...when all hope had faded...

35
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:51,649
...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

36
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:29,228
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

37
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,362
The Ring passed to Isildur...

38
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:42,700
...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

39
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,619
But the hearts of Men...

40
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:48,247
...are easily corrupted.

41
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:53,127
And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.

42
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,946
It betrayed Isildur...

43
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,201
...to his death.

44
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:33,334
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

45
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,794
...were lost.

46
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,923
History became legend...

47
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,133
...legend became myth.

48
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:44,178
And for
two and a half thousand years...

49
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,015
...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.

50
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,477
Until, when chance came...

51
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,272
...it ensnared a new bearer.

52
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:01,445
My precious.

53
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,281
The Ring came
to the creature Gollum...

54
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:08,327
...who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

55
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,497
And there it consumed him.

56
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,874
It came to me.

57
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:18,504
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:23,342
My precious.

59
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:30,474
The Ring brought
to Gollum unnatural long life.

60
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:34,520
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

61
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:39,316
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.

62
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,695
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

63
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,864
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

64
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,867
...whispers of a nameless fear.

65
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,371
And the Ring of Power perceived...

66
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,291
...its time had now come.

67
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,379
It abandoned Gollum.

68
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:05,551
But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.

69
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:11,056
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

70
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,308
What's this?

71
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,934
A Hobbit.

72
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:16,895
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

73
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,856
A ring.

74
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,858
Lost!

75
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:27,156
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,575
For the time will soon come...

77
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:34,997
...when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

78
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:42,880
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,214
...in the year 1400...

80
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,052
...by Shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:54,141
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...

82
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,935
...the Shire...

83
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,897
...Middle-earth.

84
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,863
The Third Age of this world.

85
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:23,420
There and Back Again:

86
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,839
A Hobbit's Tale.

87
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,467
By Bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,475
Now...

89
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,186
...where to begin?

90
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,522
Yes...

91
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,695
"Concerning...

92
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,531
...Hobbits."

93
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:55,244
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

94
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,413
...for many hundreds of years...

95
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,582
...quite content to ignore
and be ignored...

96
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,877
...by the world of the Big Folk.

97
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:09,925
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

98
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,262
...Hobbits must seem
of little importance...

99
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:17,474
...being neither renowned
as great warriors...

100
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:21,812
...nor counted among the very wise.

101
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,194
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,948
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

103
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:37,661
...that Hobbits' only real passion
is for food.

104
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,247
A rather unfair observation...

105
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,084
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

106
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,212
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

107
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,549
But where our hearts truly lie...

108
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,843
...is in peace and quiet...

109
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,721
...and good, tilled earth.

110
00:09:55,804 --> 00:10:01,059
For all Hobbits share a love
of things that grow.

111
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:08,692
And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.

112
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:14,031
But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:

113
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:20,496
It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.

114
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,878
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,925
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,552
Frodo!

117
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,895
Down from the door where it began

118
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:53,403
And I must follow if I can

119
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:58,492
The road goes ever on and on

120
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:02,287
Down from the door where it began

121
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:07,376
Now far ahead the road has gone

122
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,797
- And I must follow if I can
- You're late.

123
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,887
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:24,309
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,782
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

126
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,331
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,168
How is the old rascal?

128
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,298
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

129
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,884
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,052
Well, that should please him.

131
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,013
Half the Shire's been invited.

132
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,932
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

133
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,439
And so life in the Shire goes on...

134
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,692
...very much as it has
this past Age...

135
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:19,406
...full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

136
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,450
If it comes at all.

137
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:26,204
For things are made to endure
in the Shire...

138
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,833
...passing from one generation
to the next.

139
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:35,255
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

140
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,715
...in Bag End.

141
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,346
And there always will be.

142
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,391
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,020
I mean, more than usual.

144
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,981
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

145
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:58,695
He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.

146
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,043
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,905
He's up to something.

148
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,624
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

149
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,501
But I know you have something
to do with it.

150
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,836
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,255
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

152
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,090
Indeed.

153
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,592
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:09,141
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

155
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,936
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,107
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,443
Really?

158
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,034
Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,374
Fireworks, Gandalf!

160
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,047
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

161
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,941
Gandalf?

162
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:04,613
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

163
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,827
So am I.

164
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,236
No, thank you!

165
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:48,406
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

166
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,035
And what about very old friends?

167
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:56,873
Gandalf?

168
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:01,086
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

169
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:06,383
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

170
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,137
You haven't aged a day.

171
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,770
Come on, come in!

172
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,356
Welcome, welcome.

173
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,068
Here we are.

174
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,239
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

175
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,243
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

176
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:37,414
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

177
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:43,128
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one?

178
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,922
Just tea, thank you.

179
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,930
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

180
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,434
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

181
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:02,981
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've
only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

182
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,443
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

183
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,614
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

184
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:15,327
But not much for afters.
No, we're all right.

185
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,288
I've just found some sponge cake.

186
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,542
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

187
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,965
- Just tea, thank you.
- Right.

188
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,510
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

189
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,513
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

190
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,224
I'm not at home!

191
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,857
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

192
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:48,109
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

193
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,363
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

194
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,324
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

195
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,326
...never giving me a moment's peace.

196
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,705
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

197
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:05,377
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Tea.

198
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,547
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

199
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,967
All the arrangements are made.

200
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,512
Thank you.

201
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,390
Frodo suspects something.

202
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,017
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

203
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,853
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

204
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,190
You will tell him, won't you?

205
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,151
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

206
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,863
I know.

207
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,536
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

208
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,665
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

209
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,585
The woods, the fields.

210
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,046
Little rivers.

211
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,220
I am old, Gandalf.

212
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:03,893
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

213
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,606
I feel thin.

214
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,400
Sort of stretched...

215
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:15,113
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.

216
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:19,784
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

217
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:23,204
And I don't expect I shall return.

218
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,585
In fact, I mean not to.

219
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:35,383
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

220
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,320
Gandalf, my old friend...

221
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,281
...this will be a night to remember.

222
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,138
Hello, hello.

223
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:26,476
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

224
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:30,105
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

225
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,277
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- No, you don't.

226
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,114
Go on!

227
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,000
So there I was...

228
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:55,380
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

229
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,549
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

230
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,218
...about how they were
going to cook us.

231
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:05,348
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

232
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:10,019
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

233
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,690
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

234
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,193
...and turned them all to stone!

235
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,867
Quickly.

236
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,039
Up they go!

237
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,210
No, the big one.

238
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,264
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

239
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,391
Are all these children yours?

240
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,519
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

241
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:54,856
Bilbo?

242
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,234
Sackville-Bagginses!

243
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,569
Quickly, hide!

244
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,581
Thank you, my boy.

245
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,502
You're a good lad, Frodo.

246
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,589
I'm very selfish, you know.

247
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,468
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

248
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,887
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

249
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,555
...but it wasn't out of charity.

250
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,766
I think it was because...

251
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,227
...of all my numerous relations...

252
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,022
...you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

253
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,149
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

254
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,026
No.

255
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,987
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

256
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:46,407
The point is, Frodo...

257
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,454
...you'll be all right.

258
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,001
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

259
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,670
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

260
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,296
This was your idea.

261
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,647
Bilbo.

262
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,693
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

263
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,154
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

264
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:42,338
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

265
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:48,136
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

266
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,138
I might've known.

267
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:58,104
Speech, Bilbo!

268
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,398
Speech!

269
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,608
Speech!

270
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,157
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

271
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,201
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

272
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,912
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

273
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,080
...Hornblowers...

274
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,875
...Bolgers...

275
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,918
...Bracegirdles...

276
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,671
- ...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

277
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,010
Today is my 111th birthday!

278
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,430
Happy birthday!

279
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:36,893
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

280
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,896
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

281
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:43,608
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

282
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:48,363
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

283
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,493
I...

284
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,708
I have things to do.

285
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,217
I've put this off far too long.

286
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:17,016
I regret to announce this is the end!

287
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,352
I'm going now.

288
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,356
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

289
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,943
Goodbye.

290
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,354
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

291
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,941
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

292
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:12,196
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

293
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,574
It was just a bit of fun.

294
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:18,411
You're probably right, as usual.

295
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:23,374
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

296
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,294
As often as I can spare them.

297
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,672
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

298
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,134
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

299
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,638
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

300
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,684
No. Wait, it's...

301
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:46,856
...here in my pocket.

302
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,739
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

303
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:59,869
Yet, after all, why not?

304
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:06,334
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

305
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,003
Is that so hard?

306
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,463
Well, no.

307
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,383
And yes.

308
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:19,388
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

309
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,432
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

310
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:25,812
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

311
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,064
It's mine.

312
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,818
My own.

313
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:36,197
- My precious.
- Precious?

314
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,283
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

315
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:42,078
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

316
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,914
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

317
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,084
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

318
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:52,421
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

319
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:56,342
I am not trying to rob you.

320
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,099
I'm trying to help you.

321
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:14,902
All your long years,
we've been friends.

322
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,446
Trust me as you once did.

323
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:21,117
Let it go.

324
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,662
You're right, Gandalf.

325
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,458
The ring must go to Frodo.

326
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,838
It's late. The road is long.

327
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,465
Yes, it is time.

328
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,304
Bilbo.

329
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,307
The ring is still in your pocket.

330
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,603
Yes.

331
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:22,011
I've thought up an ending for my book:

332
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,726
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

333
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,313
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

334
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:34,815
Goodbye, Gandalf.

335
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:40,196
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

336
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:52,208
The road goes ever on and on

337
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:57,129
Until our next meeting.

338
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:28,244
It's mine. My own.

339
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,789
My precious.

340
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:35,084
Riddles in the dark.

341
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,669
Bilbo!

342
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,379
Bilbo!

343
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:44,927
My precious.

344
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,806
Precious.

345
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,517
He's gone, hasn't he?

346
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,314
He talked for so long about leaving...

347
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,276
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

348
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,615
Gandalf?

349
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,584
Bilbo's ring.

350
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,336
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

351
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,590
He's left you Bag End.

352
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:28,804
Along with all his possessions.

353
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,807
The ring is yours now.

354
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:37,980
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

355
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,441
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

356
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:44,820
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

357
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,324
I don't understand.

358
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,661
Neither do I.

359
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,334
Keep it secret.

360
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,211
Keep it safe.

361
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,373
Shire!

362
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,835
Baggins!

363
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:32,344
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.

364
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:36,974
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

365
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:40,769
...and the finding
of the Ring of Power."

366
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,150
"It has come to me.

367
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,820
The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

368
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:53,490
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

369
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:57,494
...for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.

370
00:33:57,578 --> 00:34:00,122
It is precious to me...

371
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,626
...though I buy it with great pain.

372
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:10,966
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

373
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,971
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

374
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:20,267
A secret now
that only fire can tell."

375
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:39,828
Shire.

376
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,956
Baggins.

377
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:46,502
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

378
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,672
That way.

379
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,930
To heal my heart and drown my woe

380
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,432
Rain may fall and wind may blow

381
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,559
But there still be

382
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,228
Many miles to go

383
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,355
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

384
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,732
And the stream that falls
From hill to plain

385
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:10,734
Better than rain or rippling brook

386
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:13,279
Is a mug of beer inside this Took

387
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,535
There's been some strange folk
crossing the Shire.

388
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:23,831
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

389
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,708
War is brewing.

390
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,295
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

391
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:32,089
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

392
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:36,760
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

393
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:39,930
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

394
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:41,557
And proud of it.

395
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,976
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Cheers.

396
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:48,272
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

397
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:52,735
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

398
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,324
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

399
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:02,995
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

400
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,581
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

401
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:10,252
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

402
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,421
Does she?

403
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,091
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

404
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,369
Is it secret? Is it safe?

405
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,380
What are you doing?

406
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,520
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

407
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:10,813
It's quite cool.

408
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,151
What can you see?

409
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,322
Can you see anything?

410
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,493
Nothing.

411
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,121
There's nothing.

412
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,665
Wait.

413
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:36,004
There are markings.

414
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:41,009
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

415
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,679
There are few who can.

416
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:49,059
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

417
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:50,727
Mordor!

418
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,105
In the common tongue, it says:

419
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,733
"One Ring to rule them all...

420
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,403
...One Ring to find them...

421
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,697
...One Ring to bring them all...

422
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,033
...and in the darkness bind them."

423
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,745
This is the One Ring...

424
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:14,251
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

425
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:18,380
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

426
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:21,717
Bilbo found it.

427
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:24,094
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

428
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:28,932
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

429
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:32,478
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

430
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:37,608
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

431
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,110
The Ring has awoken.

432
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,155
It's heard its master's call.

433
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:47,201
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

434
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:55,000
No, Frodo.

435
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:59,296
The spirit of Sauron endured.

436
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:04,760
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

437
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,262
Sauron has returned.

438
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,307
His Orcs have multiplied.

439
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,520
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

440
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:19,525
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

441
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,818
He is seeking it.

442
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:25,781
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

443
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,825
For the Ring yearns above all else...

444
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:32,329
...to return to the hand
of its master.

445
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,414
They are one...

446
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,668
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

447
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,835
Frodo...

448
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,338
...he must never find it.

449
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,548
All right.

450
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:47,219
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

451
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,055
No one knows it's here, do they?

452
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:56,937
Do they, Gandalf?

453
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,358
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

454
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,696
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

455
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:08,073
But the enemy found him first.

456
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:12,244
I don't know how long
they tortured him.

457
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:16,957
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

458
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,251
Shire!

459
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,086
Baggins!

460
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,088
Shire.

461
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,174
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

462
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,012
Who goes there?

463
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:32,973
Take it, Gandalf!

464
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,474
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

465
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:37,060
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

466
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:40,522
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

467
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:44,234
I dare not take it.

468
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,029
Not even to keep it safe.

469
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,198
Understand, Frodo...

470
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:54,494
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

471
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:05,631
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

472
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,134
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

473
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,638
No, it can't.

474
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,353
What must I do?

475
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:24,608
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

476
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:28,028
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

477
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,446
Bree.

478
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,449
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

479
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,118
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

480
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:39,039
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

481
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,166
I don't have any answers.

482
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:48,298
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

483
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:50,550
He'll know what to do.

484
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,970
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

485
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,765
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

486
00:41:57,391 --> 00:42:00,686
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

487
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,481
I can cut across country
easily enough.

488
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,318
My dear Frodo.

489
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,697
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

490
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,825
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

491
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:17,369
And yet, after a hundred years...

492
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,663
...they can still surprise you.

493
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,499
Get down.

494
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:38,306
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

495
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:42,978
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

496
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,605
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

497
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:48,692
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

498
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:49,860
Nothing important.

499
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:54,614
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...

500
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:59,494
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

501
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:01,830
No?

502
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,166
Perhaps not.

503
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,837
I've thought of a better use for you.

504
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:13,550
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

505
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,429
Be careful, both of you.

506
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,432
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

507
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:23,518
Birds, beasts.

508
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,063
Is it safe?

509
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:30,233
Never put it on...

510
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:33,779
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

511
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:35,405
Always remember, Frodo...

512
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:39,075
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

513
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:41,578
It wants to be found.

514
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:24,412
This is it.

515
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,915
This is what?

516
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,251
If I take one more step...

517
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:33,630
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

518
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:39,427
Come on, Sam.

519
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,646
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

520
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:54,025
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

521
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:58,655
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

522
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:02,951
...there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

523
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,800
Sam.

524
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:23,430
Wood-elves.

525
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:40,655
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

526
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,991
To the Grey Havens.

527
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,660
They're leaving Middle-earth.

528
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:47,996
Never to return.

529
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:53,001
I don't know why...

530
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:56,087
...it makes me sad.

531
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:02,802
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

532
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,263
Just shut your eyes...

533
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:08,224
...and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

534
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:12,312
...with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

535
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,366
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

536
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:27,369
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

537
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,040
Me neither, Sam.

538
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:03,655
Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.

539
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,532
The hour grows late.

540
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:09,285
And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...

541
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:11,955
...seeking my counsel.

542
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:16,126
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

543
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:17,544
My old friend.

544
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,421
Saruman.

545
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:27,262
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

546
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,348
So the Ring of Power has been found.

547
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:33,768
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

548
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:37,063
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

549
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:42,193
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

550
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:47,115
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

551
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,700
Time?

552
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,245
What time do you think we have?

553
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:56,624
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

554
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,960
He cannot yet take physical form...

555
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,921
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

556
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:07,635
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

557
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:14,142
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

558
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,813
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

559
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:24,986
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

560
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,822
The Eye of Sauron.

561
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:30,617
He is gathering all evil to him.

562
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,286
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army great enough...

563
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,622
...for an assault upon Middle-earth.

564
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,333
You know this?

565
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,335
How?

566
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,629
I have seen it.

567
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:46,257
A palantír is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

568
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,468
Why?

569
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:51,638
Why should we fear to use it?

570
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:58,228
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

571
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:01,606
We do not know who else
may be watching.

572
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,986
The hour is later than you think.

573
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,447
Sauron's forces are already moving.

574
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,452
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

575
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:15,912
The Nine?

576
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:19,165
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

577
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:22,043
...disguised as riders in black.

578
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:26,131
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.

579
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,968
And kill the one who carries it.

580
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,970
Frodo!

581
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:48,987
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

582
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,532
There are none who can.

583
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:57,787
Against the power of Mordor...

584
00:49:57,871 --> 00:50:00,582
...there can be no victory.

585
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:05,712
We must join with him, Gandalf.

586
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:09,340
We must join with Sauron.

587
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,679
It would be wise, my friend.

588
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:16,639
Tell me...

589
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:17,849
...friend...

590
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:23,396
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

591
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,604
I gave you the chance...

592
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,441
...of aiding me willingly...

593
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:12,737
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

594
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,512
Mr. Frodo?

595
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,931
Frodo? Frodo!

596
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:44,644
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

597
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:47,772
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

598
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:52,485
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

599
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:56,364
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

600
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,368
Frodo.

601
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,912
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

602
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:04,455
Get off him.

603
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,499
Come on, Frodo.

604
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,501
What's the meaning of this?

605
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,712
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

606
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,341
You get back here!

607
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,719
Get out of my field!

608
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:20,763
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

609
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:23,891
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

610
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,184
And some cabbages.

611
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:28,271
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

612
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:32,567
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

613
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,944
...he's clearly overreacting.

614
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:36,571
Run!

615
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:52,587
That was close.

616
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,799
I think I've broken something.

617
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,219
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

618
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:04,057
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

619
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,434
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

620
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:16,694
That's mine.

621
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:21,074
That's nice, Merry.

622
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:23,701
Here's a nice one, Sam.

623
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:26,371
I think we should get off the road.

624
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,006
Get off the road!

625
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,633
Quick!

626
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:52,814
Be quiet!

627
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,299
What was that?

628
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,500
Anything?

629
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:37,668
Nothing.

630
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,671
What is going on?

631
00:55:41,214 --> 00:55:45,009
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

632
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:47,845
Frodo?

633
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:49,597
Get down!

634
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:08,783
I have to leave the Shire.

635
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:12,161
Sam and I must get to Bree.

636
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:13,704
Right.

637
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:17,375
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

638
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,009
Run!

639
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,221
This way! Follow me!

640
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:34,809
Run!

641
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,824
Get the rope, Sam!

642
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:54,036
Frodo!

643
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,163
Run, Frodo!

644
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:57,665
- Go!
- Hurry!

645
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:00,418
Frodo, come on!

646
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,337
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

647
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:22,523
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

648
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,623
Come on.

649
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,220
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

650
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:59,602
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

651
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:03,689
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

652
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:07,234
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

653
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,863
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

654
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,574
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

655
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:16,577
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

656
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:18,871
Can't be too careful.

657
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:42,103
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

658
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:07,878
Excuse me.

659
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,757
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

660
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:18,055
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

661
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:22,810
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister...?

662
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,021
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

663
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:29,859
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

664
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:33,154
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

665
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:35,322
Gandalf.

666
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:37,908
Yes...

667
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:40,161
...I remember. Elderly chap.

668
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,414
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

669
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:45,666
Not seen him for six months.

670
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:53,716
What do we do now?

671
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,224
Sam...

672
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:04,226
...he'll be here. He'll come.

673
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:09,064
Get out of my way!

674
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:13,110
What's that?

675
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,905
This, my friend, is a pint.

676
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:17,698
It comes in pints?

677
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:21,744
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

678
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:31,921
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

679
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:36,967
Excuse me.

680
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:41,764
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

681
01:00:42,932 --> 01:00:47,353
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

682
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:52,107
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

683
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,736
Strider.

684
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:11,961
Baggins.

685
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:16,966
Baggins.

686
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:27,476
Baggins. Baggins.

687
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,605
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

688
01:01:32,398 --> 01:01:35,317
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

689
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:38,529
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

690
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,948
...and my third cousin, twice removed...

691
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,204
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

692
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:19,194
You cannot hide.

693
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:25,326
I see you.

694
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:29,747
There is no life...

695
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:32,124
...in the void.

696
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,751
Only...

697
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,170
...death.

698
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:47,056
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

699
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:52,853
What do you want?

700
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:55,022
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

701
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:58,400
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

702
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:01,278
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

703
01:03:01,362 --> 01:03:05,115
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

704
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:08,243
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

705
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:10,579
Yes.

706
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:14,625
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

707
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:21,173
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

708
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:27,012
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

709
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:30,099
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

710
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:31,225
They're coming.

711
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,435
What are they?

712
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,731
They were once Men.

713
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,525
Great kings of Men.

714
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:06,820
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

715
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:10,491
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

716
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:14,119
One by one, falling into darkness.

717
01:05:14,203 --> 01:05:16,747
Now they are slaves to his will.

718
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,876
They are the Nazgûl.

719
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:23,754
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

720
01:05:24,505 --> 01:05:26,006
At all times they feel...

721
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,133
...the presence of the Ring...

722
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:32,805
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

723
01:05:42,773 --> 01:05:45,692
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.

724
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:58,038
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

725
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:00,999
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

726
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:05,295
- ...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

727
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,757
We have no choice but to trust him.

728
01:06:08,841 --> 01:06:12,344
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

729
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:18,016
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

730
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,353
We're going to see the Elves.

731
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,296
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

732
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:50,132
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

733
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:52,509
What about second breakfast?

734
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:59,141
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

735
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:04,605
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

736
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:08,901
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

737
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:15,949
Pippin!

738
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:35,969
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

739
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:16,843
Who is she?

740
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:20,138
This woman you sing of.

741
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:26,019
'Tis the lady of Lúthien.

742
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:31,316
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

743
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,279
What happened to her?

744
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:39,992
She died.

745
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:46,373
Get some sleep, Frodo.

746
01:08:56,633 --> 01:09:00,762
The power of Isengard
is at your command...

747
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:05,350
...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

748
01:09:08,687 --> 01:09:14,484
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

749
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:24,661
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

750
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,039
We have work to do.

751
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:14,252
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

752
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,463
Rip them all down.

753
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:46,785
This was the great watchtower
of Amon Sûl.

754
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:51,164
We shall rest here tonight.

755
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:06,388
These are for you.
Keep them close.

756
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:09,015
I'm going to have a look around.

757
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:13,311
Stay here.

758
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:18,024
My tomato's burst.

759
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:20,235
Could I have some bacon?

760
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,320
Want a tomato, Sam?

761
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:26,408
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

762
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:29,369
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

763
01:11:29,453 --> 01:11:33,498
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

764
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:43,675
Go!

765
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,563
Back, you devils!

766
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,315
Frodo!

767
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,195
- Frodo.
- Sam.

768
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:47,233
Strider!

769
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:55,533
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

770
01:14:57,035 --> 01:15:01,915
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

771
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:07,629
Hurry!

772
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:11,800
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

773
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:13,760
Hold on, Frodo.

774
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:16,596
Gandalf!

775
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,382
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

776
01:17:59,551 --> 01:18:02,387
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

777
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:07,183
Is he going to die?

778
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:12,188
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

779
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:21,239
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

780
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:22,907
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

781
01:18:22,991 --> 01:18:24,200
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

782
01:18:24,284 --> 01:18:27,453
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

783
01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:45,972
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

784
01:19:10,872 --> 01:19:11,915
Frodo.

785
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:30,683
Who is she?

786
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:33,102
Frodo.

787
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:36,856
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.

788
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:41,361
He's not going to last.

789
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:44,155
We must get him to my father.

790
01:19:44,906 --> 01:19:47,825
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

791
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:54,040
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

792
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:03,216
What are they saying?

793
01:20:09,222 --> 01:20:10,890
I do not fear them.

794
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,193
Arwen...

795
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:25,530
...ride hard. Don't look back.

796
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:34,956
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

797
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:32,281
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

798
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,785
If you want him, come and claim him.

799
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:32,175
No. No!

800
01:23:35,428 --> 01:23:37,805
Frodo, no.

801
01:23:37,889 --> 01:23:40,308
Frodo, don't give in.

802
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:42,435
Not now.

803
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,865
What grace is given me...

804
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,367
...let it pass to him.

805
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:00,745
Let him be spared.

806
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:03,414
Save him.

807
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:20,973
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

808
01:24:21,432 --> 01:24:27,939
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

809
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:33,694
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

810
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:38,407
And you're lucky to be here too.

811
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:43,162
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

812
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:47,416
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

813
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:57,510
What happened, Gandalf?

814
01:24:58,469 --> 01:25:03,849
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

815
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,356
I was delayed.

816
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:15,444
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

817
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:24,203
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

818
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:27,248
Embrace the power of the Ring...

819
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:30,334
...or embrace your own destruction!

820
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:36,507
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

821
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:40,761
Only one who can bend it to his will.

822
01:25:41,554 --> 01:25:45,516
And he does not share power.

823
01:25:59,864 --> 01:26:03,242
So you have chosen death.

824
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:17,089
Gandalf? What is it?

825
01:26:18,049 --> 01:26:19,842
Nothing, Frodo.

826
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,428
Frodo!

827
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,679
Frodo!

828
01:26:23,763 --> 01:26:26,265
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

829
01:26:26,349 --> 01:26:29,101
Sam has hardly left your side.

830
01:26:29,352 --> 01:26:31,520
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

831
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:37,026
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

832
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:42,114
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

833
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:33,541
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

834
01:27:33,624 --> 01:27:35,376
Bilbo.

835
01:27:40,381 --> 01:27:42,133
"There and Back Again:

836
01:27:42,383 --> 01:27:45,136
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

837
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:51,767
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

838
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:55,896
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

839
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:58,649
...visit Lake-town...

840
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:02,278
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

841
01:28:02,695 --> 01:28:07,616
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

842
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,505
I miss the Shire.

843
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:27,052
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

844
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:30,973
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

845
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:37,521
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

846
01:28:42,735 --> 01:28:45,946
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

847
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,408
My dear boy.

848
01:28:53,496 --> 01:28:57,458
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

849
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,127
No harm in being prepared.

850
01:29:00,211 --> 01:29:02,880
- I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.

851
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:05,966
- More than anything.
- I did.

852
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:08,010
It's just...

853
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:11,472
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

854
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:15,351
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

855
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:18,854
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

856
01:29:18,938 --> 01:29:20,689
Off home.

857
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,862
You are right, Sam.

858
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:31,784
We did what we set out to do.

859
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:34,954
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

860
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,377
I am ready to go home.

861
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,255
His strength returns.

862
01:29:44,338 --> 01:29:50,094
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

863
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:53,264
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

864
01:29:53,347 --> 01:29:57,184
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

865
01:29:57,268 --> 01:30:00,646
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

866
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:06,402
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

867
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:11,156
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

868
01:30:11,407 --> 01:30:14,201
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

869
01:30:14,285 --> 01:30:17,580
Our list of allies grows thin.

870
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:21,208
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

871
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:25,045
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

872
01:30:25,129 --> 01:30:27,631
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

873
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:32,553
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

874
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:35,097
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

875
01:30:35,556 --> 01:30:39,685
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

876
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:44,189
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

877
01:30:48,027 --> 01:30:49,111
Gandalf...

878
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:53,032
...the Ring cannot stay here.

879
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:15,721
This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.

880
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:18,682
They must decide now how to end it.

881
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:23,312
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

882
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:27,608
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

883
01:31:27,691 --> 01:31:32,863
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

884
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,326
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

885
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:39,370
Men?

886
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:43,540
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

887
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:48,128
The blood of Númenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

888
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:52,007
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

889
01:31:52,091 --> 01:31:53,759
I was there, Gandalf.

890
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:57,262
I was there 3000 years ago...

891
01:32:04,103 --> 01:32:06,563
...when Isildur took the Ring.

892
01:32:06,647 --> 01:32:10,609
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

893
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:15,698
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

894
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:20,911
I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...

895
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:24,748
...where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

896
01:32:24,832 --> 01:32:27,459
Cast it into the fire!

897
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:36,427
- Destroy it!
- No.

898
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:39,930
Isildur!

899
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:45,144
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

900
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:53,485
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

901
01:32:54,403 --> 01:32:58,115
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

902
01:32:58,198 --> 01:33:03,162
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

903
01:33:03,245 --> 01:33:06,665
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

904
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:12,212
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

905
01:33:12,296 --> 01:33:14,465
He has chosen exile.

906
01:33:45,704 --> 01:33:47,748
You are no Elf.

907
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,958
Men of the South are welcome here.

908
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:54,046
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

909
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,383
Then we are here on common purpose...

910
01:33:58,759 --> 01:34:00,219
...friend.

911
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,320
The shards of Narsil.

912
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:26,245
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

913
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,416
It's still sharp.

914
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,387
But no more than a broken heirloom.

915
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:13,250
Why do you fear the past?

916
01:35:14,126 --> 01:35:19,464
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

917
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:23,135
You are not bound to his fate.

918
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:27,639
The same blood flows in my veins.

919
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:33,228
The same weakness.

920
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:38,817
Your time will come.

921
01:35:38,901 --> 01:35:43,322
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

922
01:36:33,872 --> 01:36:36,541
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

923
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:43,548
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

924
01:36:44,675 --> 01:36:46,593
And to that I hold.

925
01:36:46,677 --> 01:36:50,347
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

926
01:36:50,597 --> 01:36:54,476
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

927
01:37:03,235 --> 01:37:06,697
I choose a mortal life.

928
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:12,285
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

929
01:37:15,539 --> 01:37:18,041
...like my heart.

930
01:37:33,807 --> 01:37:37,602
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

931
01:37:37,686 --> 01:37:41,648
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

932
01:37:42,274 --> 01:37:47,154
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

933
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:50,991
You will unite, or you will fall.

934
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:55,412
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

935
01:37:57,247 --> 01:38:00,751
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

936
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:16,558
So it is true.

937
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:36,119
In a dream...

938
01:38:37,704 --> 01:38:40,832
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

939
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:42,834
...but in the West
a pale light lingered.

940
01:38:43,627 --> 01:38:45,378
A voice was crying:

941
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:48,590
"Your doom is near at hand.

942
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:52,344
Isildur's Bane is found."

943
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:58,183
Isildur's Bane.

944
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,227
Boromir!

945
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:27,212
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

946
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:31,091
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

947
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:33,343
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...

948
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:35,053
...may yet be heard...

949
01:39:35,137 --> 01:39:38,223
...in every corner of the West!

950
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:41,017
The Ring is altogether evil.

951
01:39:41,351 --> 01:39:42,853
It is a gift.

952
01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:45,522
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

953
01:39:46,148 --> 01:39:48,316
Why not use this Ring?

954
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,278
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

955
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:55,740
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

956
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,243
...are your lands kept safe.

957
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:04,374
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

958
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:08,420
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

959
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:13,133
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

960
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:16,803
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

961
01:40:17,095 --> 01:40:19,097
This is no mere Ranger.

962
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:23,768
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

963
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:27,189
You owe him your allegiance.

964
01:40:31,276 --> 01:40:33,195
Aragorn.

965
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:37,782
This is Isildur's heir?

966
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:42,829
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

967
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:52,631
Gondor has no king.

968
01:40:54,466 --> 01:40:56,134
Gondor needs no king.

969
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:06,478
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

970
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:10,982
You have only one choice.

971
01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:13,610
The Ring must be destroyed.

972
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:21,368
What are we waiting for?

973
01:41:33,505 --> 01:41:36,508
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glóin...

974
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:41,012
...by any craft that we here possess.

975
01:41:41,513 --> 01:41:45,725
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

976
01:41:45,809 --> 01:41:49,688
Only there can it be unmade.

977
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:53,400
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

978
01:41:53,483 --> 01:41:57,362
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

979
01:42:00,532 --> 01:42:02,534
One of you...

980
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:05,203
...must do this.

981
01:42:08,123 --> 01:42:11,835
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

982
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:16,381
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

983
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:21,428
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

984
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:25,765
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

985
01:42:26,558 --> 01:42:28,643
It is a barren wasteland...

986
01:42:28,727 --> 01:42:32,439
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

987
01:42:32,522 --> 01:42:36,401
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

988
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:40,905
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

989
01:42:41,156 --> 01:42:45,660
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

990
01:42:45,744 --> 01:42:48,455
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

991
01:42:48,538 --> 01:42:53,293
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

992
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:58,798
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

993
01:43:00,717 --> 01:43:03,261
Never trust an Elf!

994
01:43:04,429 --> 01:43:10,268
Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

995
01:43:10,602 --> 01:43:13,438
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

996
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:34,459
I will take it.

997
01:43:36,461 --> 01:43:38,963
I will take it.

998
01:43:44,803 --> 01:43:47,847
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

999
01:43:55,897 --> 01:43:57,148
Though...

1000
01:44:00,235 --> 01:44:02,070
...I do not know the way.

1001
01:44:04,072 --> 01:44:08,451
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1002
01:44:08,535 --> 01:44:11,955
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1003
01:44:13,081 --> 01:44:16,167
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1004
01:44:16,918 --> 01:44:18,253
...I will.

1005
01:44:21,464 --> 01:44:23,758
You have my sword.

1006
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:27,679
And you have my bow.

1007
01:44:28,263 --> 01:44:30,765
And my ax.

1008
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:40,775
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1009
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:46,448
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

1010
01:44:46,906 --> 01:44:49,325
- ...then Gondor will see it done.
- Hey!

1011
01:44:51,953 --> 01:44:56,791
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

1012
01:44:56,875 --> 01:45:01,796
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1013
01:45:02,297 --> 01:45:04,257
We're coming too!

1014
01:45:06,384 --> 01:45:09,137
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1015
01:45:09,387 --> 01:45:12,724
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1016
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:14,434
...mission.

1017
01:45:14,517 --> 01:45:16,060
Quest.

1018
01:45:16,519 --> 01:45:17,562
Thing.

1019
01:45:19,397 --> 01:45:22,066
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1020
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:25,570
Nine companions.

1021
01:45:27,405 --> 01:45:29,240
So be it.

1022
01:45:29,574 --> 01:45:32,577
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1023
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:35,163
Great!

1024
01:45:35,246 --> 01:45:37,582
Where are we going?

1025
01:46:23,654 --> 01:46:27,158
In her heart, your mother
knew you'd be hunted all your life.

1026
01:46:27,658 --> 01:46:29,327
That you'd never escape your fate.

1027
01:46:29,827 --> 01:46:33,497
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1028
01:46:33,914 --> 01:46:37,835
...but only you have the power
to wield it.

1029
01:46:38,836 --> 01:46:41,339
I do not want that power.

1030
01:46:41,505 --> 01:46:44,175
I have never wanted it.

1031
01:46:45,509 --> 01:46:48,137
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1032
01:46:52,516 --> 01:46:54,852
My old sword! Sting.

1033
01:46:55,061 --> 01:46:56,187
Here, take it. Take it.

1034
01:47:01,692 --> 01:47:05,655
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1035
01:47:06,364 --> 01:47:10,451
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

1036
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:15,206
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1037
01:47:15,414 --> 01:47:17,875
Here's a pretty thing.

1038
01:47:18,292 --> 01:47:19,585
Mithril.

1039
01:47:20,378 --> 01:47:24,757
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1040
01:47:24,965 --> 01:47:28,219
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1041
01:47:36,268 --> 01:47:38,312
My old ring.

1042
01:47:39,563 --> 01:47:43,484
I should very much like...

1043
01:47:43,734 --> 01:47:47,738
...to hold it again, one last time.

1044
01:48:05,089 --> 01:48:08,759
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1045
01:48:09,093 --> 01:48:13,222
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1046
01:48:17,727 --> 01:48:20,771
I'm sorry for everything.

1047
01:48:35,786 --> 01:48:39,999
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1048
01:48:41,333 --> 01:48:43,961
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1049
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:47,298
...nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1050
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:53,304
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1051
01:48:53,763 --> 01:48:57,683
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1052
01:48:58,225 --> 01:49:00,811
...and all Free Folk go with you.

1053
01:49:03,898 --> 01:49:07,985
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1054
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:28,923
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1055
01:49:29,465 --> 01:49:31,300
Left.

1056
01:50:50,796 --> 01:50:55,217
We must hold to this course,
west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1057
01:50:55,426 --> 01:50:59,179
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1058
01:50:59,388 --> 01:51:02,933
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

1059
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:06,937
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1060
01:51:08,772 --> 01:51:09,815
Move your feet.

1061
01:51:10,024 --> 01:51:11,358
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1062
01:51:11,567 --> 01:51:12,943
Faster!

1063
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:18,115
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1064
01:51:18,324 --> 01:51:21,076
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1065
01:51:21,577 --> 01:51:24,622
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1066
01:51:25,289 --> 01:51:29,126
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1067
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:34,840
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1068
01:51:44,058 --> 01:51:45,142
Sorry!

1069
01:51:45,976 --> 01:51:47,478
Get him!

1070
01:51:48,812 --> 01:51:51,273
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1071
01:51:51,815 --> 01:51:54,151
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1072
01:51:57,947 --> 01:51:59,573
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1073
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:02,660
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1074
01:52:02,910 --> 01:52:05,621
It's moving fast.

1075
01:52:05,829 --> 01:52:07,998
Against the wind.

1076
01:52:08,791 --> 01:52:10,918
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1077
01:52:11,126 --> 01:52:13,837
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1078
01:52:47,246 --> 01:52:48,998
Spies of Saruman.

1079
01:52:49,748 --> 01:52:53,043
The passage south is being watched.

1080
01:52:54,211 --> 01:52:57,548
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1081
01:53:10,185 --> 01:53:11,895
Frodo!

1082
01:53:30,873 --> 01:53:33,125
Boromir.

1083
01:53:33,375 --> 01:53:37,588
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1084
01:53:37,796 --> 01:53:40,924
...over so small a thing.

1085
01:53:44,136 --> 01:53:46,096
Such a little thing.

1086
01:53:46,305 --> 01:53:47,765
Boromir!

1087
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:51,101
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1088
01:54:00,903 --> 01:54:02,946
As you wish.

1089
01:54:03,655 --> 01:54:05,657
I care not.

1090
01:54:41,068 --> 01:54:45,781
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

1091
01:54:45,989 --> 01:54:50,577
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1092
01:54:51,870 --> 01:54:54,832
If the mountain defeats you...

1093
01:54:55,082 --> 01:54:59,503
...will you risk
a more dangerous road?

1094
01:55:11,849 --> 01:55:14,726
There is a fell voice on the air.

1095
01:55:15,853 --> 01:55:17,354
It's Saruman!

1096
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:30,909
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1097
01:55:31,201 --> 01:55:32,995
No!

1098
01:56:39,436 --> 01:56:41,271
We must get off the mountain!

1099
01:56:41,772 --> 01:56:46,109
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1100
01:56:46,276 --> 01:56:49,613
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1101
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:53,533
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1102
01:56:53,784 --> 01:56:56,620
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1103
01:56:58,455 --> 01:57:02,292
Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

1104
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:07,965
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1105
01:57:08,799 --> 01:57:13,679
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

1106
01:57:14,972 --> 01:57:18,475
Shadow and flame.

1107
01:57:21,812 --> 01:57:24,481
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1108
01:57:29,194 --> 01:57:31,321
We cannot stay here!

1109
01:57:31,488 --> 01:57:34,324
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1110
01:57:34,491 --> 01:57:36,201
Frodo?

1111
01:57:39,204 --> 01:57:42,082
We will go through the mines.

1112
01:57:42,833 --> 01:57:44,710
So be it.

1113
01:57:51,341 --> 01:57:55,304
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1114
01:57:58,849 --> 01:58:01,018
How is your shoulder?

1115
01:58:01,226 --> 01:58:04,521
- Better than it was.
- And the Ring?

1116
01:58:06,023 --> 01:58:08,525
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1117
01:58:09,026 --> 01:58:11,945
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1118
01:58:12,362 --> 01:58:16,283
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1119
01:58:16,450 --> 01:58:19,036
And, I fear, from within.

1120
01:58:21,705 --> 01:58:25,876
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1121
01:58:26,043 --> 01:58:28,879
Trust your own strengths.

1122
01:58:29,046 --> 01:58:31,631
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1123
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:33,884
...for good or for evil.

1124
01:58:34,051 --> 01:58:36,386
Some are greater than I am.

1125
01:58:36,887 --> 01:58:40,557
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1126
01:58:41,892 --> 01:58:43,268
The walls...

1127
01:58:43,977 --> 01:58:46,063
...of Moria.

1128
01:58:51,777 --> 01:58:54,780
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1129
01:58:54,988 --> 01:58:59,409
Their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1130
01:58:59,785 --> 01:59:02,287
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1131
01:59:10,295 --> 01:59:13,590
Well, let's see.

1132
01:59:13,799 --> 01:59:15,175
Ithildin.

1133
01:59:15,801 --> 01:59:19,179
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1134
01:59:33,235 --> 01:59:37,322
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1135
01:59:37,906 --> 01:59:42,536
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1136
01:59:42,786 --> 01:59:47,541
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1137
02:00:11,314 --> 02:00:12,441
Nothing's happening.

1138
02:00:19,448 --> 02:00:23,660
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

1139
02:00:23,994 --> 02:00:26,830
...Men and Orcs.

1140
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:28,331
What are you going to do, then?

1141
02:00:28,498 --> 02:00:30,750
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1142
02:00:31,001 --> 02:00:33,003
And if that does not shatter them...

1143
02:00:33,170 --> 02:00:35,881
...and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1144
02:00:36,047 --> 02:00:39,509
...I will try to find the opening words.

1145
02:00:52,355 --> 02:00:54,900
Mines are no place for a pony.

1146
02:00:55,108 --> 02:00:59,196
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1147
02:01:00,363 --> 02:01:03,200
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1148
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:07,245
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1149
02:01:14,044 --> 02:01:16,630
Do not disturb the water.

1150
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,715
It's useless.

1151
02:01:31,394 --> 02:01:33,563
It's a riddle.

1152
02:01:36,316 --> 02:01:39,444
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1153
02:01:39,819 --> 02:01:42,739
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1154
02:01:44,241 --> 02:01:45,534
Mellon.

1155
02:02:03,593 --> 02:02:08,431
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1156
02:02:08,932 --> 02:02:14,604
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1157
02:02:16,106 --> 02:02:19,192
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1158
02:02:19,568 --> 02:02:21,945
And they call it a mine.

1159
02:02:22,153 --> 02:02:24,114
A mine!

1160
02:02:25,156 --> 02:02:28,493
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1161
02:02:32,789 --> 02:02:34,207
No.

1162
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:36,209
No...

1163
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:39,129
No!

1164
02:02:41,798 --> 02:02:43,300
Goblins.

1165
02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:51,516
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1166
02:02:52,601 --> 02:02:55,145
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1167
02:02:57,981 --> 02:03:00,317
- Frodo!
- Help!

1168
02:03:00,525 --> 02:03:02,152
Strider!

1169
02:03:02,319 --> 02:03:05,155
- Help!
- Get off him!

1170
02:03:05,322 --> 02:03:06,323
Aragorn!

1171
02:03:16,750 --> 02:03:17,834
Frodo!

1172
02:03:19,002 --> 02:03:20,545
Strider!

1173
02:03:44,152 --> 02:03:45,195
Into the mines!

1174
02:03:45,362 --> 02:03:48,573
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1175
02:03:52,869 --> 02:03:54,663
Run!

1176
02:04:11,554 --> 02:04:15,100
We now have but one choice.

1177
02:04:15,308 --> 02:04:20,230
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1178
02:04:20,438 --> 02:04:22,399
Be on your guard.

1179
02:04:22,607 --> 02:04:26,069
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1180
02:04:26,236 --> 02:04:29,781
...in the deep places of the world.

1181
02:04:37,747 --> 02:04:41,710
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1182
02:04:41,918 --> 02:04:45,755
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1183
02:05:31,509 --> 02:05:35,221
The wealth of Moria is not in gold...

1184
02:05:35,388 --> 02:05:37,807
...or jewels...

1185
02:05:37,974 --> 02:05:41,019
...but mithril.

1186
02:05:59,370 --> 02:06:04,292
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1187
02:06:04,501 --> 02:06:08,505
- That was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1188
02:06:08,671 --> 02:06:10,548
I never told him...

1189
02:06:10,715 --> 02:06:15,678
...but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

1190
02:06:28,024 --> 02:06:29,734
Pippin.

1191
02:06:50,421 --> 02:06:53,049
I have no memory of this place.

1192
02:06:55,134 --> 02:06:56,636
- Are we lost?
- No.

1193
02:06:56,845 --> 02:06:59,347
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1194
02:06:59,556 --> 02:07:00,974
- Merry?
- What?

1195
02:07:01,266 --> 02:07:03,226
I'm hungry.

1196
02:07:14,529 --> 02:07:18,992
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1197
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:23,329
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1198
02:07:23,538 --> 02:07:27,709
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1199
02:07:28,376 --> 02:07:30,044
...or was set loose.

1200
02:07:30,545 --> 02:07:34,215
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1201
02:07:36,843 --> 02:07:39,596
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1202
02:07:39,762 --> 02:07:45,518
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1203
02:07:45,685 --> 02:07:50,565
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1204
02:07:50,732 --> 02:07:56,696
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1205
02:07:57,614 --> 02:08:00,408
Before it drove him mad.

1206
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:03,578
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1207
02:08:03,745 --> 02:08:04,954
Pity?

1208
02:08:06,039 --> 02:08:08,917
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1209
02:08:09,834 --> 02:08:15,048
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1210
02:08:16,466 --> 02:08:18,968
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1211
02:08:21,387 --> 02:08:25,350
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1212
02:08:25,558 --> 02:08:28,478
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1213
02:08:29,062 --> 02:08:34,984
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1214
02:08:35,777 --> 02:08:38,613
...before this is over.

1215
02:08:40,114 --> 02:08:43,993
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1216
02:08:50,625 --> 02:08:54,003
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1217
02:08:55,421 --> 02:08:57,465
I wish none of this had happened.

1218
02:08:57,632 --> 02:09:02,679
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1219
02:09:03,513 --> 02:09:09,018
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1220
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:14,524
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1221
02:09:14,899 --> 02:09:17,318
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1222
02:09:17,819 --> 02:09:22,156
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1223
02:09:22,323 --> 02:09:25,535
And that is an encouraging thought.

1224
02:09:30,415 --> 02:09:32,333
It's that way.

1225
02:09:32,542 --> 02:09:34,836
- He's remembered.
- No.

1226
02:09:35,044 --> 02:09:38,840
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1227
02:09:39,048 --> 02:09:44,220
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1228
02:09:59,068 --> 02:10:03,197
Let me risk a little more light.

1229
02:10:07,869 --> 02:10:09,954
Behold...

1230
02:10:10,371 --> 02:10:15,585
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1231
02:10:18,087 --> 02:10:21,507
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1232
02:10:46,407 --> 02:10:48,117
Gimli!

1233
02:10:53,915 --> 02:10:55,374
No.

1234
02:10:55,583 --> 02:10:57,210
No!

1235
02:10:59,754 --> 02:11:02,924
No.

1236
02:11:04,759 --> 02:11:06,052
No.

1237
02:11:13,309 --> 02:11:15,311
"Here lies Balin...

1238
02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:17,772
...son of Fundin...

1239
02:11:18,106 --> 02:11:20,733
...Lord of Moria."

1240
02:11:21,776 --> 02:11:23,444
He is dead, then.

1241
02:11:25,613 --> 02:11:26,823
It's as I feared.

1242
02:11:45,133 --> 02:11:48,052
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1243
02:11:48,261 --> 02:11:52,974
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1244
02:11:54,058 --> 02:11:56,644
We have barred the gates...

1245
02:11:57,311 --> 02:11:59,814
...but cannot hold them for long.

1246
02:11:59,981 --> 02:12:02,817
The ground shakes.

1247
02:12:03,192 --> 02:12:04,819
Drums...

1248
02:12:05,194 --> 02:12:08,573
...drums in the deep.

1249
02:12:12,118 --> 02:12:14,162
We cannot get out.

1250
02:12:16,164 --> 02:12:20,001
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1251
02:12:21,669 --> 02:12:24,213
We cannot get out.

1252
02:12:27,216 --> 02:12:29,177
They are coming."

1253
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:14,055
Fool of a Took!

1254
02:13:14,388 --> 02:13:18,226
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1255
02:13:44,168 --> 02:13:45,795
Frodo!

1256
02:13:48,089 --> 02:13:49,590
Orcs.

1257
02:13:56,639 --> 02:13:58,641
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1258
02:14:05,898 --> 02:14:07,692
They have a cave-troll.

1259
02:14:23,499 --> 02:14:24,667
Let them come!

1260
02:14:25,167 --> 02:14:28,713
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1261
02:16:47,601 --> 02:16:50,354
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1262
02:16:55,109 --> 02:16:56,777
Frodo!

1263
02:17:30,311 --> 02:17:32,146
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1264
02:17:33,147 --> 02:17:35,024
Frodo!

1265
02:18:20,194 --> 02:18:22,071
Frodo!

1266
02:18:24,865 --> 02:18:26,325
Frodo!

1267
02:19:22,298 --> 02:19:23,632
No.

1268
02:19:32,016 --> 02:19:33,892
He's alive.

1269
02:19:36,312 --> 02:19:39,315
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1270
02:19:39,648 --> 02:19:41,817
You should be dead.

1271
02:19:42,026 --> 02:19:44,528
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1272
02:19:44,778 --> 02:19:49,533
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1273
02:19:55,331 --> 02:19:56,457
Mithril.

1274
02:19:59,251 --> 02:20:01,837
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1275
02:20:07,843 --> 02:20:09,803
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1276
02:20:24,777 --> 02:20:26,362
This way!

1277
02:21:36,765 --> 02:21:39,768
What is this new devilry?

1278
02:21:55,868 --> 02:21:58,662
A Balrog.

1279
02:21:58,954 --> 02:22:02,124
A demon of the ancient world.

1280
02:22:04,293 --> 02:22:06,754
This foe is beyond any of you.

1281
02:22:07,921 --> 02:22:09,465
Run!

1282
02:22:16,805 --> 02:22:18,307
Quickly!

1283
02:22:34,948 --> 02:22:36,200
Gandalf.

1284
02:22:36,825 --> 02:22:38,452
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1285
02:22:39,828 --> 02:22:42,331
The bridge is near.

1286
02:22:44,416 --> 02:22:48,504
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1287
02:23:17,658 --> 02:23:19,368
Gandalf!

1288
02:23:37,678 --> 02:23:38,887
Merry! Pippin!

1289
02:23:50,023 --> 02:23:51,567
Sam!

1290
02:23:54,278 --> 02:23:57,531
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1291
02:24:00,576 --> 02:24:01,994
Not the beard!

1292
02:24:15,215 --> 02:24:17,092
Steady.

1293
02:24:19,219 --> 02:24:20,888
Hold on!

1294
02:24:41,950 --> 02:24:43,118
Hang on!

1295
02:24:53,921 --> 02:24:55,631
Lean forward!

1296
02:24:58,634 --> 02:24:59,635
Steady.

1297
02:25:00,969 --> 02:25:02,137
Come on!

1298
02:25:02,387 --> 02:25:03,889
Now!

1299
02:25:21,114 --> 02:25:22,908
Over the bridge!

1300
02:25:23,158 --> 02:25:24,660
Fly!

1301
02:26:09,371 --> 02:26:11,373
You cannot pass!

1302
02:26:11,540 --> 02:26:13,208
Gandalf!

1303
02:26:17,421 --> 02:26:22,300
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1304
02:26:23,301 --> 02:26:27,055
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1305
02:26:37,065 --> 02:26:39,067
Go back to the Shadow.

1306
02:26:46,908 --> 02:26:51,329
You shall not pass!

1307
02:27:18,482 --> 02:27:22,360
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1308
02:27:30,035 --> 02:27:32,496
Fly, you fools!

1309
02:27:36,625 --> 02:27:38,794
No!

1310
02:27:44,966 --> 02:27:47,135
Aragorn!

1311
02:28:44,359 --> 02:28:47,195
Legolas, get them up.

1312
02:28:51,324 --> 02:28:53,160
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1313
02:28:53,326 --> 02:28:56,955
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1314
02:28:57,164 --> 02:29:00,500
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1315
02:29:01,376 --> 02:29:04,713
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1316
02:29:06,214 --> 02:29:08,383
On your feet, Sam.

1317
02:29:08,717 --> 02:29:10,218
Frodo?

1318
02:29:12,304 --> 02:29:14,014
Frodo!

1319
02:30:06,524 --> 02:30:09,069
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1320
02:30:09,778 --> 02:30:13,949
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1321
02:30:14,157 --> 02:30:16,701
An Elf-witch...

1322
02:30:17,244 --> 02:30:20,121
...of terrible power.

1323
02:30:20,664 --> 02:30:22,874
All who look upon her...

1324
02:30:23,083 --> 02:30:24,876
...fall under her spell.

1325
02:30:25,085 --> 02:30:26,378
Frodo!

1326
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:30,674
And are never seen again.

1327
02:30:30,882 --> 02:30:35,387
Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1328
02:30:35,595 --> 02:30:39,307
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.

1329
02:30:39,474 --> 02:30:41,268
Mr. Frodo?

1330
02:30:46,564 --> 02:30:52,153
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1331
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:56,908
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1332
02:31:04,582 --> 02:31:09,170
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1333
02:31:27,314 --> 02:31:29,607
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

1334
02:31:29,774 --> 02:31:31,693
Speak words we can all understand!

1335
02:31:31,860 --> 02:31:36,448
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1336
02:31:36,698 --> 02:31:39,242
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1337
02:31:46,166 --> 02:31:48,126
That was not so courteous.

1338
02:31:54,674 --> 02:31:58,720
You bring great evil with you.

1339
02:32:00,472 --> 02:32:02,682
You can go no further.

1340
02:32:39,928 --> 02:32:42,597
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1341
02:32:43,723 --> 02:32:45,600
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1342
02:32:47,102 --> 02:32:50,438
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1343
02:32:51,314 --> 02:32:54,442
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1344
02:32:57,404 --> 02:32:59,447
You will follow me.

1345
02:33:11,126 --> 02:33:13,128
Caras Galadhon.

1346
02:33:13,753 --> 02:33:16,714
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1347
02:33:16,881 --> 02:33:22,554
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1348
02:34:41,549 --> 02:34:44,677
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1349
02:34:45,345 --> 02:34:50,517
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1350
02:34:52,227 --> 02:34:56,689
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1351
02:34:56,940 --> 02:34:58,733
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1352
02:34:58,942 --> 02:35:02,070
For I much desire to speak with him.

1353
02:35:02,237 --> 02:35:05,031
I can no longer see him from afar.

1354
02:35:05,907 --> 02:35:11,079
Gandalf the Grey did not
pass the borders of this land.

1355
02:35:11,329 --> 02:35:13,748
He has fallen into Shadow.

1356
02:35:18,461 --> 02:35:22,966
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1357
02:35:24,592 --> 02:35:28,346
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1358
02:35:29,055 --> 02:35:32,433
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1359
02:35:34,561 --> 02:35:37,772
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1360
02:35:38,439 --> 02:35:41,734
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1361
02:35:46,489 --> 02:35:50,785
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1362
02:35:51,077 --> 02:35:53,413
...Gimli, son of Glóin.

1363
02:35:54,414 --> 02:35:57,959
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1364
02:35:59,419 --> 02:36:02,088
...and in all lands...

1365
02:36:02,255 --> 02:36:05,758
...love is now mingled with grief.

1366
02:36:18,396 --> 02:36:21,107
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1367
02:36:21,649 --> 02:36:24,652
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1368
02:36:27,614 --> 02:36:30,908
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1369
02:36:31,075 --> 02:36:34,162
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1370
02:36:34,912 --> 02:36:37,749
...to the ruin of all.

1371
02:36:42,086 --> 02:36:47,925
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1372
02:36:49,469 --> 02:36:54,182
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1373
02:36:54,641 --> 02:36:58,311
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1374
02:37:00,563 --> 02:37:02,690
Tonight, you will sleep...

1375
02:37:02,857 --> 02:37:06,277
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1376
02:37:07,862 --> 02:37:09,656
...one who has seen the Eye!

1377
02:37:24,295 --> 02:37:26,881
A lament for Gandalf.

1378
02:37:34,138 --> 02:37:35,682
What do they say about him?

1379
02:37:35,890 --> 02:37:38,559
I have not the heart to tell you.

1380
02:37:41,312 --> 02:37:43,564
For me, the grief is still too near.

1381
02:37:46,526 --> 02:37:49,362
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1382
02:37:49,529 --> 02:37:52,573
There should be a verse about them.

1383
02:37:56,119 --> 02:37:58,121
The finest rockets ever seen

1384
02:37:59,247 --> 02:38:02,083
They burst in stars of blue and green

1385
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:06,421
Or after thunder, silver showers

1386
02:38:08,923 --> 02:38:11,718
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1387
02:38:11,884 --> 02:38:15,763
That doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1388
02:38:26,607 --> 02:38:29,277
Take some rest.

1389
02:38:29,444 --> 02:38:32,155
These borders are well-protected.

1390
02:38:32,363 --> 02:38:34,907
I will find no rest here.

1391
02:38:37,744 --> 02:38:40,747
I heard her voice inside my head.

1392
02:38:40,955 --> 02:38:44,709
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1393
02:38:44,917 --> 02:38:50,381
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1394
02:38:51,758 --> 02:38:54,594
But I cannot see it.

1395
02:38:55,928 --> 02:38:58,431
It is long since we had any hope.

1396
02:39:08,608 --> 02:39:10,735
My father is a noble man.

1397
02:39:11,486 --> 02:39:13,738
But his rule is failing...

1398
02:39:14,071 --> 02:39:19,494
...and our people lose faith.

1399
02:39:20,912 --> 02:39:24,457
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1400
02:39:24,624 --> 02:39:28,169
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1401
02:39:31,005 --> 02:39:34,008
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1402
02:39:34,634 --> 02:39:36,677
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1403
02:39:36,844 --> 02:39:40,681
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1404
02:39:41,349 --> 02:39:44,852
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1405
02:39:47,730 --> 02:39:49,690
Have you ever been called home...

1406
02:39:49,857 --> 02:39:53,820
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1407
02:39:54,445 --> 02:39:57,698
I have seen the White City...

1408
02:39:58,032 --> 02:39:59,534
...long ago.

1409
02:40:00,493 --> 02:40:05,456
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1410
02:40:06,374 --> 02:40:09,335
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1411
02:40:09,794 --> 02:40:13,130
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1412
02:41:20,323 --> 02:41:22,867
Will you look into the mirror?

1413
02:41:23,034 --> 02:41:24,577
What will I see?

1414
02:41:27,538 --> 02:41:29,874
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1415
02:41:30,791 --> 02:41:32,627
For the mirror...

1416
02:41:32,835 --> 02:41:35,379
...shows many things.

1417
02:41:38,382 --> 02:41:40,760
Things that were...

1418
02:41:40,968 --> 02:41:43,554
...things that are...

1419
02:41:44,305 --> 02:41:46,265
...and some things...

1420
02:41:49,852 --> 02:41:53,147
...that have not yet come to pass.

1421
02:43:15,730 --> 02:43:18,566
I know what it is you saw.

1422
02:43:20,985 --> 02:43:23,487
For it is also in my mind.

1423
02:43:25,239 --> 02:43:29,326
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1424
02:43:31,704 --> 02:43:36,584
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1425
02:43:37,209 --> 02:43:40,504
He will try to take the Ring.

1426
02:43:40,713 --> 02:43:42,715
You know of whom I speak.

1427
02:43:43,716 --> 02:43:48,387
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1428
02:43:49,889 --> 02:43:52,349
If you ask it of me...

1429
02:43:52,725 --> 02:43:55,770
...I will give you the One Ring.

1430
02:43:56,854 --> 02:43:59,023
You offer it to me freely.

1431
02:44:03,611 --> 02:44:07,531
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1432
02:44:13,913 --> 02:44:17,208
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1433
02:44:17,625 --> 02:44:21,462
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1434
02:44:22,088 --> 02:44:25,132
Treacherous as the sea!

1435
02:44:25,633 --> 02:44:30,554
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1436
02:44:31,013 --> 02:44:33,390
All shall love me...

1437
02:44:33,599 --> 02:44:36,435
...and despair.

1438
02:44:50,533 --> 02:44:54,829
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1439
02:44:55,121 --> 02:44:57,581
...and go into the West...

1440
02:44:57,790 --> 02:45:02,253
- ...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1441
02:45:05,840 --> 02:45:10,010
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1442
02:45:10,928 --> 02:45:12,429
...is to be alone.

1443
02:45:15,766 --> 02:45:18,519
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1444
02:45:18,686 --> 02:45:20,312
And I am its keeper.

1445
02:45:23,524 --> 02:45:27,153
This task was appointed to you.

1446
02:45:28,195 --> 02:45:31,073
And if you do not find a way...

1447
02:45:32,283 --> 02:45:34,285
...no one will.

1448
02:45:34,660 --> 02:45:37,830
Then I know what I must do.

1449
02:45:38,497 --> 02:45:39,707
It's just...

1450
02:45:42,960 --> 02:45:45,212
...I'm afraid to do it.

1451
02:45:48,716 --> 02:45:53,846
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1452
02:45:59,185 --> 02:46:04,899
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1453
02:46:05,691 --> 02:46:09,028
They were Elves once.

1454
02:46:10,196 --> 02:46:13,532
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1455
02:46:13,741 --> 02:46:16,911
...tortured and mutilated.

1456
02:46:17,244 --> 02:46:22,541
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1457
02:46:22,833 --> 02:46:24,668
And now...

1458
02:46:26,128 --> 02:46:28,005
...perfected.

1459
02:46:28,714 --> 02:46:31,884
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1460
02:46:33,844 --> 02:46:36,180
...whom do you serve?

1461
02:46:36,388 --> 02:46:38,891
Saruman!

1462
02:46:59,745 --> 02:47:03,207
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1463
02:47:03,415 --> 02:47:06,293
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1464
02:47:06,543 --> 02:47:09,463
You will taste Man-flesh!

1465
02:47:14,551 --> 02:47:18,264
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1466
02:47:18,430 --> 02:47:22,601
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1467
02:47:24,436 --> 02:47:25,729
Kill the others.

1468
02:47:44,915 --> 02:47:50,337
Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.

1469
02:47:51,463 --> 02:47:55,301
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1470
02:48:02,474 --> 02:48:04,018
Lembas.

1471
02:48:04,268 --> 02:48:05,853
Elvish waybread.

1472
02:48:08,355 --> 02:48:11,358
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1473
02:48:17,865 --> 02:48:19,825
How many did you eat?

1474
02:48:19,992 --> 02:48:21,660
Four.

1475
02:48:27,458 --> 02:48:30,044
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1476
02:48:30,252 --> 02:48:34,381
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.

1477
02:48:34,548 --> 02:48:37,051
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

1478
02:48:37,259 --> 02:48:41,055
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1479
02:48:41,263 --> 02:48:46,352
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1480
02:48:58,947 --> 02:49:00,282
By river you have the chance...

1481
02:49:00,449 --> 02:49:03,660
...of outrunning the enemy
to the Falls of Rauros.

1482
02:49:20,928 --> 02:49:25,766
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1483
02:49:26,016 --> 02:49:29,520
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1484
02:49:34,900 --> 02:49:37,361
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1485
02:49:37,528 --> 02:49:41,532
They have already seen service in war.

1486
02:49:41,698 --> 02:49:43,951
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1487
02:49:44,118 --> 02:49:47,454
You will find your courage.

1488
02:49:49,331 --> 02:49:51,291
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

1489
02:49:51,458 --> 02:49:54,044
...Eleven rope made of hithlain.

1490
02:49:54,211 --> 02:49:56,338
Thank you, my lady.

1491
02:49:58,132 --> 02:50:01,468
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1492
02:50:07,933 --> 02:50:10,978
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1493
02:50:11,145 --> 02:50:13,272
Nothing.

1494
02:50:13,897 --> 02:50:17,234
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1495
02:50:17,860 --> 02:50:23,073
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1496
02:50:30,122 --> 02:50:31,665
Actually...

1497
02:50:31,874 --> 02:50:33,500
There was one thing.

1498
02:50:34,334 --> 02:50:37,004
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

1499
02:50:37,171 --> 02:50:39,965
Stupid to ask.

1500
02:50:42,509 --> 02:50:44,636
I have nothing greater to give...

1501
02:50:44,803 --> 02:50:48,390
...than the gift you already bear.

1502
02:51:14,041 --> 02:51:17,127
That choice is yet before her.

1503
02:51:17,711 --> 02:51:20,631
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1504
02:51:20,964 --> 02:51:26,803
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1505
02:51:26,970 --> 02:51:31,308
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1506
02:51:58,877 --> 02:52:02,089
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1507
02:52:02,256 --> 02:52:05,676
I give you the light of Eärendil...

1508
02:52:06,426 --> 02:52:08,762
...our most beloved star.

1509
02:52:17,896 --> 02:52:22,276
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1510
02:52:22,526 --> 02:52:26,613
...when all other lights go out.

1511
02:52:35,455 --> 02:52:38,625
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1512
02:52:39,251 --> 02:52:43,547
...having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1513
02:52:44,298 --> 02:52:47,634
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1514
02:52:47,884 --> 02:52:49,803
What was her gift?

1515
02:52:50,012 --> 02:52:54,933
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1516
02:52:55,726 --> 02:52:58,604
She gave me three.

1517
02:54:40,747 --> 02:54:44,209
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1518
02:54:47,921 --> 02:54:51,049
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1519
02:54:51,258 --> 02:54:54,428
But he's too clever a waterman.

1520
02:54:55,262 --> 02:54:58,598
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1521
02:54:58,765 --> 02:55:01,017
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1522
02:55:01,184 --> 02:55:03,270
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1523
02:55:03,437 --> 02:55:06,523
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1524
02:55:06,690 --> 02:55:09,776
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1525
02:55:10,736 --> 02:55:13,739
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

1526
02:55:13,905 --> 02:55:15,073
But you're not.

1527
02:55:15,365 --> 02:55:17,868
I'm here to help you.

1528
02:55:18,034 --> 02:55:19,745
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1529
02:55:25,709 --> 02:55:28,462
You can't help me, Sam.

1530
02:55:30,589 --> 02:55:32,299
Not this time.

1531
02:55:35,218 --> 02:55:37,304
Get some sleep.

1532
02:55:43,560 --> 02:55:45,771
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1533
02:55:46,313 --> 02:55:49,065
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1534
02:55:49,733 --> 02:55:51,985
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1535
02:55:52,319 --> 02:55:55,197
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1536
02:55:55,655 --> 02:55:57,657
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1537
02:55:59,493 --> 02:56:02,329
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1538
02:56:02,496 --> 02:56:05,499
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1539
02:56:05,707 --> 02:56:09,002
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1540
02:56:09,252 --> 02:56:11,463
But you will not see that.

1541
02:56:11,797 --> 02:56:13,215
You are afraid!

1542
02:56:13,465 --> 02:56:16,009
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1543
02:56:16,301 --> 02:56:19,763
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1544
02:56:22,182 --> 02:56:26,520
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1545
02:56:38,365 --> 02:56:39,741
Frodo.

1546
02:56:41,618 --> 02:56:43,119
The Argonath.

1547
02:56:46,540 --> 02:56:50,293
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1548
02:56:51,044 --> 02:56:52,963
My kin.

1549
02:58:11,958 --> 02:58:14,127
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1550
02:58:14,377 --> 02:58:16,963
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1551
02:58:17,130 --> 02:58:20,634
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Yes?

1552
02:58:21,051 --> 02:58:24,888
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1553
02:58:25,055 --> 02:58:28,308
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1554
02:58:28,475 --> 02:58:31,603
And after that, it gets even better.

1555
02:58:31,978 --> 02:58:36,942
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1556
02:58:37,108 --> 02:58:38,485
That is our road.

1557
02:58:40,070 --> 02:58:43,281
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1558
02:58:43,490 --> 02:58:45,241
Recover my...

1559
02:58:48,244 --> 02:58:50,246
- We should leave now.
- No.

1560
02:58:50,413 --> 02:58:54,876
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1561
02:58:55,085 --> 02:58:58,505
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1562
02:58:58,755 --> 02:59:02,759
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1563
02:59:03,259 --> 02:59:07,430
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1564
02:59:09,432 --> 02:59:14,396
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1565
02:59:14,896 --> 02:59:16,606
Where's Frodo?

1566
02:59:42,215 --> 02:59:44,134
None of us should wander alone.

1567
02:59:45,552 --> 02:59:47,637
You, least of all.

1568
02:59:47,846 --> 02:59:50,306
So much depends on you.

1569
02:59:51,349 --> 02:59:53,309
Frodo?

1570
03:00:00,442 --> 03:00:02,986
I know why you seek solitude.

1571
03:00:03,695 --> 03:00:07,157
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1572
03:00:07,949 --> 03:00:10,994
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1573
03:00:12,579 --> 03:00:15,206
There are other ways, Frodo.

1574
03:00:15,457 --> 03:00:19,252
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1575
03:00:19,502 --> 03:00:23,256
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1576
03:00:23,506 --> 03:00:26,593
Warning? Against what?

1577
03:00:26,760 --> 03:00:28,887
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1578
03:00:29,095 --> 03:00:32,724
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1579
03:00:32,974 --> 03:00:36,728
- ...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1580
03:00:38,521 --> 03:00:41,858
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1581
03:00:43,401 --> 03:00:45,487
- If you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

1582
03:00:46,696 --> 03:00:50,366
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1583
03:00:52,202 --> 03:00:55,538
What chance do you think you have?

1584
03:00:55,705 --> 03:01:00,376
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1585
03:01:00,627 --> 03:01:04,297
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1586
03:01:06,424 --> 03:01:08,551
You fool!

1587
03:01:08,718 --> 03:01:12,722
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1588
03:01:12,889 --> 03:01:15,725
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1589
03:01:15,892 --> 03:01:17,227
- Give it to me!
- No!

1590
03:01:17,393 --> 03:01:19,229
- Give it to me!
- No.

1591
03:01:26,903 --> 03:01:28,905
I see your mind.

1592
03:01:29,155 --> 03:01:32,075
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1593
03:01:32,283 --> 03:01:34,160
You will betray us!

1594
03:01:34,410 --> 03:01:37,580
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1595
03:01:38,039 --> 03:01:41,668
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1596
03:01:48,758 --> 03:01:50,260
Frodo?

1597
03:01:54,597 --> 03:01:56,182
Frodo.

1598
03:02:00,103 --> 03:02:02,105
What have I done?

1599
03:02:02,313 --> 03:02:04,065
Please, Frodo.

1600
03:02:04,274 --> 03:02:06,943
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1601
03:02:07,152 --> 03:02:09,028
Frodo!

1602
03:02:55,491 --> 03:02:56,910
Frodo?

1603
03:02:58,161 --> 03:03:01,247
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?

1604
03:03:01,497 --> 03:03:03,249
Stay away!

1605
03:03:03,666 --> 03:03:05,251
Frodo!

1606
03:03:07,503 --> 03:03:11,341
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1607
03:03:21,017 --> 03:03:23,519
Would you destroy it?

1608
03:03:28,524 --> 03:03:30,443
Aragorn.

1609
03:03:33,863 --> 03:03:36,199
Aragorn.

1610
03:03:38,034 --> 03:03:39,869
Elessar.

1611
03:03:47,543 --> 03:03:50,880
I would have gone with you to the end.

1612
03:03:51,547 --> 03:03:54,384
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1613
03:03:57,720 --> 03:03:58,888
I know.

1614
03:04:01,391 --> 03:04:06,813
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1615
03:04:10,566 --> 03:04:12,318
Go, Frodo!

1616
03:04:15,321 --> 03:04:16,823
Run.

1617
03:04:17,073 --> 03:04:18,741
Run!

1618
03:04:43,266 --> 03:04:44,934
Mr. Frodo!

1619
03:04:54,235 --> 03:04:55,987
Find the halfling!

1620
03:04:57,613 --> 03:05:00,158
Find the halfling!

1621
03:05:03,619 --> 03:05:05,288
Elendil!

1622
03:05:11,794 --> 03:05:13,379
Aragorn, go!

1623
03:05:35,068 --> 03:05:36,402
Frodo!

1624
03:05:36,986 --> 03:05:38,571
Hide here. Quick!

1625
03:05:39,197 --> 03:05:40,656
Come on!

1626
03:05:43,159 --> 03:05:45,161
What's he doing?

1627
03:05:49,415 --> 03:05:51,417
He's leaving.

1628
03:05:56,172 --> 03:05:59,092
- No!
- Pippin!

1629
03:06:04,013 --> 03:06:06,349
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1630
03:06:06,933 --> 03:06:10,019
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1631
03:06:10,436 --> 03:06:12,021
- Over here!
- This way!

1632
03:06:22,865 --> 03:06:25,201
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1633
03:07:20,590 --> 03:07:23,634
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1634
03:08:06,719 --> 03:08:07,845
Run!

1635
03:11:39,432 --> 03:11:41,058
No.

1636
03:11:44,895 --> 03:11:47,940
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1637
03:11:48,274 --> 03:11:50,359
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1638
03:11:52,236 --> 03:11:53,654
I let Frodo go.

1639
03:11:54,363 --> 03:11:56,949
Then you did what I could not.

1640
03:11:57,950 --> 03:12:01,287
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1641
03:12:01,787 --> 03:12:06,083
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1642
03:12:06,292 --> 03:12:08,586
I did not see it.

1643
03:12:08,794 --> 03:12:11,964
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1644
03:12:12,423 --> 03:12:14,967
You fought bravely.

1645
03:12:15,259 --> 03:12:17,928
You have kept your honor.

1646
03:12:18,471 --> 03:12:20,431
Leave it.

1647
03:12:20,765 --> 03:12:22,808
It is over.

1648
03:12:23,976 --> 03:12:29,273
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1649
03:12:29,690 --> 03:12:32,693
...and my city to ruin.

1650
03:12:36,781 --> 03:12:39,492
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1651
03:12:39,658 --> 03:12:43,662
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1652
03:12:44,663 --> 03:12:47,166
...nor our people fail.

1653
03:12:48,167 --> 03:12:49,502
Our people.

1654
03:12:53,339 --> 03:12:55,466
Our people.

1655
03:13:17,196 --> 03:13:20,199
I would have followed you, my brother.

1656
03:13:21,742 --> 03:13:23,744
My captain.

1657
03:13:26,372 --> 03:13:28,332
My king.

1658
03:13:47,977 --> 03:13:50,229
Be at peace...

1659
03:13:50,563 --> 03:13:52,565
...son of Gondor.

1660
03:14:09,081 --> 03:14:12,418
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1661
03:14:12,918 --> 03:14:15,921
But he will not return.

1662
03:14:39,111 --> 03:14:41,113
Frodo!

1663
03:15:00,591 --> 03:15:03,844
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1664
03:15:05,137 --> 03:15:08,140
I wish none of this had happened.

1665
03:15:11,101 --> 03:15:13,854
So do all who live
to see such times...

1666
03:15:14,063 --> 03:15:17,483
...but that is not for them to decide.

1667
03:15:17,650 --> 03:15:20,319
All you have to decide...

1668
03:15:20,569 --> 03:15:25,324
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1669
03:15:54,144 --> 03:15:56,188
Frodo, no!

1670
03:15:56,689 --> 03:15:58,023
Frodo!

1671
03:15:58,857 --> 03:16:01,527
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1672
03:16:05,030 --> 03:16:07,032
Go back, Sam!

1673
03:16:07,533 --> 03:16:11,120
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1674
03:16:11,328 --> 03:16:14,164
And I'm coming with you!

1675
03:16:14,623 --> 03:16:17,042
You can't swim!

1676
03:16:20,838 --> 03:16:22,548
Sam!

1677
03:16:28,137 --> 03:16:29,430
Sam!

1678
03:17:10,387 --> 03:17:13,098
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1679
03:17:13,432 --> 03:17:17,770
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1680
03:17:18,896 --> 03:17:21,482
And I don't mean to.

1681
03:17:21,774 --> 03:17:23,942
I don't mean to.

1682
03:17:25,611 --> 03:17:27,446
Sam.

1683
03:17:42,294 --> 03:17:43,962
Come on.

1684
03:18:12,449 --> 03:18:16,995
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1685
03:18:31,844 --> 03:18:36,849
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1686
03:18:40,310 --> 03:18:45,190
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1687
03:18:57,035 --> 03:19:00,205
Not if we hold true to each other.

1688
03:19:01,540 --> 03:19:06,044
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1689
03:19:07,045 --> 03:19:12,301
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1690
03:19:13,552 --> 03:19:15,596
We travel light.

1691
03:19:15,804 --> 03:19:17,723
Let us hunt some Orc.

1692
03:19:20,684 --> 03:19:22,728
Yes!

1693
03:19:41,705 --> 03:19:43,123
Mordor.

1694
03:19:43,749 --> 03:19:47,127
I hope the others find a safer road.

1695
03:19:48,086 --> 03:19:50,631
Strider will look after them.

1696
03:19:51,590 --> 03:19:54,927
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1697
03:19:55,260 --> 03:19:57,721
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1698
03:19:57,930 --> 03:19:59,431
We may.

1699
03:20:01,558 --> 03:20:02,601
Sam...

1700
03:20:06,230 --> 03:20:08,857
...I'm glad you are with me.
